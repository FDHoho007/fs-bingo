# FSinfo Bingo

This is a simple static site for playing bingo locally.
The values for the bingo cards can be found in bingos/ and are just json arrays.
These will be shuffled and displayed as a bingo card when this site is opened.
The site will automatically determine the right bingo to choose by the subdomain used to open the site.
For example julian.fs.bingo will show a bingo card with the values from bingos/julian.json.
